# basic_MLAI_scripts
Bunch of scripts to test or learn ML/AI concepts

## mnist_from_scratch
The script is mostly a replica of the code available at 

https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning

and wonderfully explained in his online book

http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html

Unlike that code, this one is updated for running with python3. The differences are more subtle than just a change to the print statement
